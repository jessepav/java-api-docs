    <TD width="621" align="left"><p>The ReportMill evaluation is a fully functional, never-expiring, final
        version of ReportMill. It simply adds a watermark to generated reports
        in its unlicensed form. To eliminate the watermark, simply install a
        valid license key.</p>
      <p>License keys need to be installed for the user account that executes
        the deployed application. This is frequently different than the developer
        account
    and may be one of the common administrator accounts (&quot;administrator&quot;, &quot;root&quot;,
      &quot;nobody&quot;). If you are unsure which user is running the deployment
      application, you can find the ReportMill
      warning that
      is printed (to the console or standard out) for unlicensed frameworks:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Initializing ReportMill (Build Date: Feb-11-08, Version 11.0, JVM-1.5.2)</li>
        <li>Warning: Unlicensed copy of ReportMill for host xxx and user yyy</li>
      </ul>    
    <p>To install the license key, simply log in as the appropriate user
      and execute the following command:</p>
      <p> prompt&gt; java -cp &lt;jar_path&gt;/ReportMillX.jar com.reportmill.Shell
         -license &lt;license_key&gt;</p>    
      <p>For example, for RM11:</p>
      <p>prompt&gt; java -cp /ProjectJars/ReportMill11.jar com.reportmill.Shell
        XXX-XXX-XXX</p>
      <p>ReportMill should respond with &quot;License is valid and has been installed
    on host xxx. for user yyy&quot;.</p>
    <p><strong>Licensing Programmatically</strong></p>
      <p>Alternatively, you can call the method ReportMill.setLicense(&quot;&lt;license_key&gt;&quot;), 
        before any other ReportMill code is used. This is the recommended approach 
        for ISV applications, but not for enterprise deployment (where different 
        keys may be required depending on individual deployments).</p>
      <p>Similarly, you could call com.reportmill.Shell.main() with a String
        array, new String() { &quot;-license&quot;, &quot;&lt;license_key&gt;&quot; }. This would only
        need to be called once for a given server, and is equivalent to the above
        java command.</p>
      <p><strong>Licensing the layout application</strong></p>
    <p>The developer license simply removes the demo alert panel which appears
    when you launch the layout application. You can enter your developer license,
      by selecting the menu Tools-&gt;Preferences and clicking the &quot;License&quot; tab.
    You can also conveniently add your deployment license here as an option to
      the above method (for cases when a GUI is available).</p>
    <p><strong>One Machine, One License</strong></p>
    <p>Note, since your license covers CPUs - you may install the license key
    for any number of users on a single machine. Also, you may re-use a single
      license key for testing and redundancy machines (ReportMill only charges
      for actual deployment CPUs).</p>
    <p><strong>Trouble Shooting</strong></p>
    <p>So far, these steps have worked for all customers. The most common problem
    is installing the license key for the wrong user account. Be sure and check
    the warning message discussed above to avoid or fix this. If you have other
    feedback, please send a note to <a href="mailto:support@reportmill.com">support@reportmill.com</a>.</p></TD>
