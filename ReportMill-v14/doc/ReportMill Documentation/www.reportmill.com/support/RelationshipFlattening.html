      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of
          the most important concepts in ReportMill is that of &quot;Dataset Keys&quot;.
          ReportMill has a number of dataset elements used to display datasets
          (tables, graphs,  crosstabs, labels). Each of these expect
          a &quot;dataset key&quot; to identify the dataset they should display.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">For instance,
          a simple report using the sample Hollywood dataset might have a table
          that iterates over all the studios from the given datasource. This
          table might use the &quot;Studios&quot; dataset key and show one record/table-row
          for each studio.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Now it's
          also common for dataset objects to each have a list themselves, in
          a &quot;master-detail&quot; type construct. In this case, each studio has a
          list of movies released by that studio. And, in rare cases, you may
          find that though your application only provides data of a higher level
          entity, like Studio, you may actually want to run a report on a consolidated
          dataset of a child entity, like a combined list of each Studio's list
          of movies.</font></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">To handle
          this, ReportMill has a feature that lets you automatically get  a
          consolidated set of objects derived from a child dataset found in each
          object of a &quot;master&quot; dataset. In the case of our example, we could
          run a report on movies by setting the table dataset key to &quot;Studios.getMovies&quot;.</font> </p>
      <strong><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Reports
      Independent of the Master</font></strong>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">One of
          the most important aspects of relationship flattening is that it lets
          you create reports that are independent of the actual &quot;master&quot;. Once
          we have chose the dataset key &quot;Studios.getMovies&quot;, the actual root
          entity is a Movie. So we can easily show a report of all movies in
          our dataset grouped by Category and ignore the fact that the movies
          originally came from a list of studios.</font></p>
      <p><strong><font size="4" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Accessing
            the Master</font></strong></p>
      <p><font size="3" face="Georgia, Times New Roman, Times, serif">Even though
          relationship flattening effectively gives us a list of the &quot;details&quot;
          from the master-detail construct, it is often still handy to reference
          the Master, particularly if the details don't have an explicit back-pointer.
          This can be done in one of two ways. The first is that you can simply
          use the prefix of your dataset key. So if the studio has a &quot;getStudioName&quot;
          attribute, you can reference it with the &quot;Studios.getStudioName&quot; key.
          Also, ReportMill will recognize a reference to the Master's class,
          so if each object in Studios is of class Studio, you can also use the
          key &quot;Studio.getStudioName&quot;. </font></p>
