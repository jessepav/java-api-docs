    <TD width="637" align="left"><p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
      <p>Most ReportMill customers are very familiar with the text substitution
        that forms the core of report generation. ReportMill turns tags such
        as &quot;@Date@&quot; and &quot;Page @Page@ of @PageMax@&quot; into text
        such as &quot;October
      21, 1999&quot; and &quot;Page 1 of 12&quot;.</p>
      <p>However, ReportMill offers another very powerful form of data substitution
        in the Image Substitution feature. This feature is very useful for embedding
        images in a report which need to change from report to report (or even
        from table row to table row)- whether they come from a product image
        database, the filesystem or a
        graphics
      library.</p>
      <p>To utilize this feature, simply select the Tools-&gt;Add Image Placeholder
      menu item.</p>
      <p><strong>Set Image Key </strong></p>
      <p>When you select the Image placeholder, the inspector will show the attributes
        of the placeholder. The &quot;Key&quot; field allows you to specify the key or expression that will provide the image data. Simply enter or drag in the key or expression to this field.</p>
      <p>Usually, this key will be a simple key (like getLogo, getImageData, etc.) but it can be any complex ReportMill expression. Here's an example of how you might construct an image key that uses an actual web service that can return a barcode image, given a number. </p>
      <blockquote>
        <p>&quot;http://bcgen.com:7001/ida/servlet/LinearServlet?BARCODE=&quot; + getProductID </p>
      </blockquote>
      <p><strong>Value Types</strong></p>
      <p>With image substitution, ReportMill expects the supplied key to resolve
          to one of the following types of objects: String, byte[], File or URL.
        ReportMIll supports the following image types: GIF,
        TIFF,
        JPEG,
        PNG,
        BMP, and
        PDF.</p>
      <p><strong>Passing a String Value</strong></p>
      <p>If you are providing a string,
        it should be an absolute path to a file in the file system or a URL to
        a image available via an HTTP service.</p>      <p><strong>Passing a Byte Array</strong></p>
      <p>If you provide a byte array (byte[]), it should be exactly the bytes
      of an image file as it would appear on disk.</p>      <p><strong>Providing Image Data in UserInfo</strong></p>
      <p>If you added your image placeholder at the root level of your document
        (or perhaps in the header row of a table) you'll probably want to provide
        the image data in the UserInfo. The UserInfo parameter is designed for
        providing this type of additional information.
        It can
        be a simple Java.util.Map with a key called &quot;MyImage&quot; corresponding
        to a value of type String, byte array, etc.</p>
      <p><strong>Tables: Providing Image Data as an Object Method or Attribute</strong></p>
      <p>ReportMill
        performs image substitution using the exact same mechanism as text substitution.
        If you added your image placeholder to a detail
        table row, ReportMill will try to evaluate the image key against your
        table objects (perhaps to show a different image in each row) and use
        UserInfo as a fallback. This would be the case if you had an Employee
        object with a method called employeePicture, which returned image data.
        The key might look like &quot;employeePicture&quot; and
      return a byte[] loaded from the database.</p>
      <p><strong>Image Sources</strong></p>
      <p>Customers have used the image substitution facility to
          add graphs to their reports from sources such as NetCharts (www.chartworks.com),
              Pop Charts (www.corda.com) or other graphing libraries. Any source
              that can
              provide image data in the aforementioned formats can be used in
        conjunction with ReportMill.</p>
      <p><strong>An Example</strong></p>
      <p>Here's an example of a simple stand-alone Java class that generates
        a report from an object that knows how to generate a chart using Java
        2D: [<a href="RMImageTest.java">RMImageTest.java</a>] [<a href="RMImageTest.pdf">RMImageTest.pdf</a>]</p>
