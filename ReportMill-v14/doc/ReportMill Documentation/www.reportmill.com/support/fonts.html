    <TD width="625" align="left"><p><strong>Overview</strong></p>
      <p>The ReportMill design application allows you to select from all available
        system fonts (or at least those available to the Java Runtime).
        The most important aspect of ReportMill and fonts is that you generally
        want to ensure that the exact same fonts chosen for your templates (on
        your design machine) are available on your deployment server. This can
        sometimes be problematic, because different platforms ship with different
        sets of base fonts. </p>
      <p><strong>Fonts available to the Java Runtime </strong></p>
      <p>ReportMill uses the Java.awt.Font object for
         font information. You can check what fonts are available in your deployment
        runtime with the following code:</p>
      <p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prompt&gt; java -cp
        ReportMill10.jar com.reportmill.Shell -fonts</p>
      <p>This corresponds to the following Java code GraphicsEnvironment.getAllFonts().
        If any font used in your template does not show up in this list on your
        server, ReportMill will perform font substitution and your reports will
      likely look somewhat different on the server.</p>
      <p><strong>Font Substitution Warning</strong></p>
      <p>If a font referenced in your template is not available at runtime on
        the server, ReportMill will print a warning to System.err in the following
        format:</p>
      <p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;RMFont: Couldn't find font for Arial (using
        Garamond)</p>
      <p>If your reports look like they are using the wrong font, look for this
        message in the console to see if your system is missing a particular
        font. </p>
      <p><strong>PDF Base fonts (Arial, Courier, Times, Helvetica) </strong></p>
      <p>When generating PDF, there is a base set of fonts that are particularly
        efficient and consistent. Adobe's PDF spec guarantees that the fonts
        listed above are available to all PDF viewers, so ReportMill can reference
        these fonts without having to embed the outlines of the fonts in the
        PDF, which results in smaller PDF files. However, if used, these fonts
        do still need to be present on the server.</p>
      <p><strong></strong><strong>Windows</strong></p>
      <p>Windows users shouldn't have any problem since a large number of TrueType
        fonts ship with Windows in the C:/Windows/Fonts directory and Java seems
        to use any font located in that directory. </p>
      <p><strong>Mac OS X</strong></p>
      <p>The Mac can be a little trickier for a couple reasons. First, it seems
        that the Java Runtime finds all system fonts when someone is logged into
        the console (in /Library/Fonts, ~/Library/Fonts and /System/Library/Fonts).
        However, if a server application is later launched when the user console
        isn't active, Java tends to only find fonts in $JAVA_HOME/lib/fonts (where
        JAVA_HOME is /System/Library/Frameworks/JavaVM.framework/Home).
        So the most reliable approach to using Mac OS X as a server deployment
        machine is to copy fonts used in the template there.</p>
      <p>However, the second problem is that many fonts on the Mac are not packaged
        as straight TrueType (.ttf) files, but are instead packaged as Font Suitcases,
        whereby several individual font files from the same family are archived
        into one file, either in the resource fork of a Mac OS file (these usually
        have no extension) or the data fork (these files usually end in .dfont).
        Java cannot read these files directly (again, when there is no user logged
        into the console).</p>
      <p>The answer may be to get the .ttf files from another source or to use
        a utility to extract them from the non-standard Mac OS X packaging. In
        the past we've been able to extract 
        &quot;.ttf&quot; files from &quot;.dfont&quot; files with the Fondu utility
        (<a href="http://sourceforge.net/projects/fondu">http://sourceforge.net/projects/fondu</a>).</p>
      <p><strong>Solaris, Linux, others</strong></p>
      <p>If you are deploying on Solaris, Linux or any other server environment, 
        you may be surprised at how few fonts are provided with the standard distribution. 
        Copy any fonts that you have used in your templates to the <strong>jre/lib/fonts</strong> 
        directory in your JRE distribution (this should be something like /usr/local/java/jre/lib/fonts).</p>
      <p>Also, please refer to platform specific documentation on fonts for both
        the platform and the JRE for that platform. </p>
      <p><strong>Linux</strong></p>
      <p>Recently we've heard that certain Linux distributions may have additional 
        steps to make additional fonts available to the JRE. Check the documentation 
        for your Linux release, but here are some notes from one of our developers:</p>
      <p>1) Copy the fonts to a font directory in /usr/share/fonts<br>
        2) CD to that dir and execute:<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; prompt&gt; fonts.dir<br>
        &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;prompt&gt; /usr/sbin/chkfontpath 
        --add /usr/share/fonts/&lt;your_font_dir&gt;<br>
        4) Restart the font server by executing prompt&gt; /etc/rc.d/init.d/xfs 
        restart<br>
        5) open the fonts.dir file and copy the lines that have been added for 
        your new fonts (An example would be: MyFont.ttf -macromedia-Secure1-medium-r-normal--0-0-0-0-p-0-iso10646-1) 
        to the end of the font.properties file under java/jre/lib</p>
      <p><strong>Legacy (Java 1.3)</strong></p>
      <p>For Java 1.3, ReportMill will fall back on it's native
          TrueType font parsing
          technology. Under these conditions, it will be necessary to copy the
          fonts to a standard location in the file system so ReportMill can find
          them:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>C:/Winnt/Fonts (Windows only)</li>
        <li>~/ReportMill/Fonts ('~' is the deployment account's home directory)</li>
        <li>~/Library/Fonts</li>
        <li>~/Library/ReportMill/Fonts</li>
      </ul>      
      <p>If ReportMill fails to find the font file, it will print a warning to 
        the console. This warning also contains a full list of the locations that 
        ReportMill looked for font files. Use this to verify the location of the 
        deployment account's home directory ('~'). Additionally, the native ReportMill 
        TrueType font parsing is not as complete as the AWT font parsing and may 
        fail to load some incorrectly coded TrueType fonts (font designers often 
        take liberties with the spec, which makes it hard to offer complete support 
        of all fonts).</p>
